# Creating of Readme file
This gives suggestions and templates for a good README.

Kindly choose which sections apply to yours as every project or preference is different

## Name
Here You Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Describe to people what your project is all about and what specifically it can do.

Provide context and add [Name_links](#your-link) to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with.

List the features of the project.

Kindly mention as well if there are different versions of the project.
  

### Visuals
Add visual like screenshots, gif or video if your project requires it for better description.

Use tools like ttygif or Asciinema to make things easier for you.

### Requirements
List all your requirements here especially 

if your project only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or 

has dependencies that have to be installed manually.

Sample:

* Windows 7, 8.1, 10
* Python version 3.6 or 3.7



### Installation
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```
Sample:

1. clone this repository.

2. create a virtual environment with python 3.x for the project
    * Click [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to learn how to 
    create virtual environment for python project

3. Run the following command to install the packages in the requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
 or in case you are not using virtual environment and have multiple python versions installed.
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```


Consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. 

Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. 



### Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can.

Like with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo 

Sample:

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

sample:
```bash
